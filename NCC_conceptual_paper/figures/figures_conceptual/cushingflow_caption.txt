Current caption:
Fig X: A flow diagram for forecasting fitness effects of climate change due to the Cushing Hypothesis, following the hypothesis itself we focus on consumers. First, both major assumptions must be met; if, for example, consumer density is the major controller on fitness, then no further work is warranted. If both assumptions met forecasting requires both knowledge of the mechanisms and the pre-climate change baseline. In some cases the mechanism predicts the pre-climate change baseline (i.e., in both our examples), and we color mechanisms in whether they predict both pre-climate change synchrony and asynchrony depending on specifics (purple), synhcrony (blue) or asynchrony (red). Note that multiple mechanisms may operate in many systems


Refs if needed:
For bet-hedging- it'll depend on the type so we'll have to be more specific. The Hopper 1999 paper cited in the Johansson paper was a good resource! I think we want to focus on fine-grained spatio-temporal bet-hedging rather than temporal which seem to relate more to abiotic environment and thus relate more to assumption 1.
