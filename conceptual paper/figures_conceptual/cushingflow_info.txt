We are a little slippery on assumptions and how testing them relates to mechanisms ... and then predictions. I wondered if a figure that fleshes this out for us (and the audience?) might help.

I didn't finish the figure but the way it goes is a flow diagram to get from the hypothesis to predictions:

First you test the assumptions: If they are NOT MET you get your first prediction (see figure).

If they ARE MET then you test for a pre-climate change baseline. I am not sure what terms to use here but I think most studies assume the peak of the curve before climate change (I called this 'synchrony'). 

From 'synchrony' then you could make some simple predictions: as asynchrony increases fitness of consumer declines, at some extreme it is zero. (I think we could highlight this pathway from testing assumption to predictions in one color and point out that many studies aim to do this or assume this ...).

Other pathways:

Assumptions met to asynchrony: puts you a on sub-pathway BEFORE predictions to test the mechanism underlying asynchrony (we list a few) and then you get to predicts based on mechanism underlying asynchrony. 

Assumptions only somewhat met (especially 1, right?) put you a a sub-pathway to test mechanistically why they are not met. This should eventually have an arrow that points back up to 'test pre-climate change baseline.'

I was hoping we could also fit FOOD WEB studies in here ... these are ones that don't really measure fitness, right? So maybe we could have some text to the LEFT of the current boxes that says 'assumptions not tested' --> food web studies.... what do you think?

HK comments:

- Love this idea!!

- In general- I think we can be more deliberate with our language in the figure and in the text. 

- I think we should have boxes around each grouping of text :)

- Can't decide whether we should have numbered boxes

- Thoughts on flow of diagram: 
box 1: assumptions met? 
box 2: mechanism of hypothesis known? (rather than 'somewhat', although not sure how to link assumptions and mechanisms, I imagine we want to focus on mechanisms testing hypothesis?)
box 3: baseline hypotheses
box 4: baseline predictions
box 5: ultimate goal:
box X: assumptions NOT met 

- I think you can test assumptions with food web studies without fitness data, or at least test that consumer dynamics dependent on resource. 

- Box for assumptions: Consumer and resource show seasonality in their periods of activity vs. dormancy (?)

- Can you bold/underline titles of each box

- Not sure how much text we should have in the boxes vs in the Figure caption.

- Box for baseline- Include word 'hypothesis' with (H1) synchrony: consumer fitness was highest before climate change (i.e. consumer fitness was matched to the peak availability of its resource) and (H2) asynchrony: consumer fitness was not highest before climate change (i.e. consumer fitness was not matched to the peak availability of its resource). Again, not sure if these words need to be in the box or in caption.

- For asynchrony- test hypothesis first or test mechanism? Does prediction change depending on mechanism? Seems like it could get complicated fast if we get too specific? Seems to me to suggest studies test hypothesis then mechanism

- include somewhere, potentially in Box with baseline hypotheses- mechanisms for asynchrony: alternative life-history strategies (e.g., maximizing fecundity over mortality, bet-hedging), phenological cues not historically correlated but are now synchronized. Also thinking type of interaction (mutualism less likely to face mismatch than predator-prey given direction of selection pressures) but because we're only focusing on trophic in our review, not sure if we should include

- I think baseline predictions should include climate change because without cc, they're just straight predictions of Cushing...


- Box for baseline predictions:[these are independent of mechanism] If climate change increases the gap in the relative timing of a consumer and resource (i.e. increases the number of days between the key life history events of a consumer and resource), 
prediction for H1: consumer fitness should decline and at some extreme limit, decline to zero. 
prediction for H2: no associated change in consumer fitness


- Box X- "No, assumptions not met"

- Include box at the end of the circuit? Predict mismatch based on climate change

- EMW comment: I think we could highlight this pathway from testing assumption to predictions in one color and point out that many studies aim to do this or assume this ...
- HK comment in response: Not sure exactly what you mean but sounds like it could be good!
** EMW on 15 Feb 2019: I have no idea either! **

EMW

- Currently figure does not include life history studies versus food web ones: any ideas how to include or include in caption or skip including?

- HK wrote: "Box for baseline- Include word 'hypothesis' with (H1) synchrony: consumer fitness was highest before climate change (i.e. consumer fitness was matched to the peak availability of its resource) and (H2) asynchrony: consumer fitness was not highest before climate change (i.e. consumer fitness was not matched to the peak availability of its resource). Again, not sure if these words need to be in the box or in caption." ...

EMW: I just put synchrony and asynchrony for now .. Let me know how you want me to change.

- Text mechanisms: I think we maybe should mention only ultimate mechanisms (aren't cues just proximate) or clearly label proximate versus ultimate ... also, I tried color coding mechanisms that go with asynchrony versus synchrony .. what do you think, can we add more?

- Testing mechanisms and testing baseline are supposed to happen at the same time(ish) according to the current figure and working out each one will help inform the other (feedback arrow)

- I adjusted predictions a touch, take a look and let me know how you want the text changed. 

- What did I miss?

- What else should we change?

HK comments with EMW replies ... 
(1) Changes look good!
(2) It occurs to me that we can be a lot clearer about mechanisms in the main text too. We hint that we need to test mechanisms but never address them head on (until the baseline section). EMW: Yes!

(3) I think we can separate mechanisms by food web vs. life history. I also think we need to make it even more clear which ones relate to synchrony vs. asynchrony. 
(4) One idea we could do is have a box of general mechanisms (though still food web vs. life history) and then specify potential mechanisms in the box with the two baseline hypotheses
e.g. general mechanism= optimal timing depends on trade-offs between the costs of (a-)synchrony and the costs of mistiming other events; specific one for synchrony= prioritize mortality over fecundity vs. asynchrony= maximize fecundity over mortality)

-> EMW (in reply to 3-4 comments): Okay, I worry this might be too much for one box though ... so we need to:
(a) Figure out what the goal of the figure is then work towards that, eliminating some stuff along the way.
(b) I am not sure we have enough space to separate out synchrony/asynchrony mechanisms and food-web/life history mechanisms. If we do it has to be an extra column of the flow, so we have to decide what comes first. I am not sure the mechanisms should be separated into boxes ... they should be somewhat consistent in some cases, no?
(c) If we don't do this we could *either* focus on just synchrony and follow through food web/life history OR focus on life history and follow through on synchrony/asynchrony. Based on how the flow works now, we are only focusing on asynchrony when it occurs due to some OTHER reason than Cushing hypothesis assumptions not being met.
(d) *So, it would help me a LOT if you can tell me what the 'ultimate goal' people would follow this flow chart is for. And if you could send a PDF sketch (you can just do it on paper) of the major mechanisms we think belong in this flow chart and what they lead to, feel free to also color code or such by life-history or food web. At this point I think the back and forth by text is not helping me enough.*


(5) Is there a reason why box around assumptions is red? Could be confusing with the asynchrony colour -- EMW: No, we can change all the colors once the figure is closer to final.
(6) wondering about resource quality vs. quantity
(7) I think we want to be careful about not getting into the context in which mismatch occur, which we argue in our intro has been reviewed elsewhere. Another reason to only get into ultimate mechanisms ?? Instead of interaction type we could say co-evolution
-> EMW (6-7) I think this sounds good, but then what is the ultimate goal in the figure? To forecast synchrony/asynchrony and resulting fitness? That is match/mismatch. We need a clear goal for the flow diagram, otherwise, why follow it?

(8) Singer and Parmesan also suggest that genetic constraints on size or phenology could be another mechanism for asynchrony
-> EMW (re 8) We could probably come up with 20+ mechanisms ... we either need to classify into smaller groups (related to theory ... so 'constraints related to body size' or such where it's obvious what we mean) or we need to focus on what we think are the top mechanisms. As I am not sure it's useful to tell people to test 20+ mechanisms. 

(9) I think having the asynchrony in  'if climate change causes asynchrony' could be confusing although I don't have a better suggestion

Looking good!

I like the two boxes to separate Cushing vs. climate change- related aspects

I think there are too many boxes for the examples

Assumption 1- not top down,
Assumption 2- I've been wondering about consumer-resources in number of generations/generation time e.g. insect that has multiple generations in a summer with a perennial plant... BUT that's a really specific case

I like adding actual organisms- we should add to all then. can you list steps for each example box
example 1- do you have a non-insect one :)?
example 2- winter moth
example 3- also insect  (not sure how specific we want to be but can get spp from Hopper 1999)

I'm not sure what to do about the relationship between the assumptions and mechanism boxes. Maybe it's about adding another option/pathway and changing wording back to- assumptions met? yes, no, unknown (if unknown test ultimate mechanisms-> assumptions now met? yes- move on to climate change OR no
