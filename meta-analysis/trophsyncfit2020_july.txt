Back to synchrony and fitness
Updated 11 Sep 2020 (see HMK074)

<><> Take-homes on plotting <><>
Could you plot fitness versus mismatch?
(HMK11) Yes (though do they give the actual fitness data anywhere?)
(HMK30) Yes, though I was not convinced they knew what should match up (they have effectively defined a 0, they just haven't tried to defend it)
(HMK41) Maybe. Though they don't define 0 and they don't give enough detail on caterpillar phenology data. 
(HMK42) No. Not based on the paper alone, but I think you could add zeros to their caterpillar data and get peaks most years. 

No one really measured total fitness, but even these metrics seem clearly influenced by way more than resource availability. 

<><> Further notes on the papers <><>
HMK11
14 y 
Where: Finland, boreal forest
Intxn: bird (willow tit, resident) x caterpillars
Climate: spring temperature
Phenology: birds (onset of egg laying and time of hatching, all 1 d accuracy, weekly abundance of caterpillars but measured as "middle of measurement period with highest abundance" and they seem to have issues with finding a peak, they also discuss that there's more likely a threshold than a peak that matters)
Zero (peak energetic demand versus peak resource) defined? YES (10 d after hatching or 8-13 d)
Fitness: nestling survival rate and mean nestling weight (pretty sure it's not TOTAL for an individual but I think they have the data to get total)

Good argument that caterpillars are main food. 
Also measured clutch size. Worked on first clutch, not sure they discussed how many clutches are common. 


HMK30
Where: Greenland 
Intxn: plants x caribou
Climate: sea ice and temperature
Phenology: 50% of species emergence 
Zero (peak energetic demand versus peak resource) defined? Used a 'Trophic Mismatch Index' which is defined in Post & Forchhammer 2008 as "percent of plant species emerged on date of 50% caribou births"... given their naming and stuff you can pretend it has a zero, but feels very suspect to me
Fitness: "early calf mortality" and calf production 



HMK41
Where: Netherlands
Intxn: bird (pied flycatcher, migratory, no clear mention of clutches) x caterpillars
Climate: spring temperature
Phenology: Very little detail on the phenology! Would have to dig into methods/other papers. 
Zero (peak energetic demand versus peak resource) defined? Did not find clear info on this at all, but could guess at it. 
Fitness: They measured # recruits (birds born that bred the next year) and the two components of that: # of receipts and probably fledging became receipts; but in analyses they seem to use 'Standardized selection gradient' (which is linear relationship between egg laying date versus # recruits). Could be that they have total fitness as they have tagged birds. 

Did not find a fitness x mismatch relationship, they argue it's because spring temperature mattered more (but it was hard to tell if they teased out spring temp versus arrival date) so focused on resource not being key determinant of fitness 

Height of resource peak mattered to fitness. 

I think they use Standardized selection gradient as they are trying to understand what drives fitness by timing relationship -- they get the selection estimate and compare to various things (year, arrival temperature), including the resource (mismatch). 


HMK42
Where: New Hampshire (Hubbard Brook)
Intxn: bird (black throated blue warbler -- BBBW, multibrooded migratory bird) x caterpillars x plants
Climate: spring temperature
Phenology:
Zero (peak energetic demand versus peak resource) defined? No, because they say there is no peak in caterpillar abundance, but if you look at their data they COULD get a peak in many years (but perhaps not the LOW caterpillar years, which is interesting) if they added the zeros that must occur before and after their sampling, so if you ask me it's partly a BIG sampling issue here. 
Fitness: annual estimates of daily survival probability maybe and then mean annual reproductive success as fledging #/year for a bird pair


They reject seasonality of prey hypothesis, and they also mention prey is not dominant controller on fitness. They say spring leaf emergence does predict bird timing and lots of other interesting points.


<><> Thoughts I had <><>
- Trying to add in the 0 point (where peak energetic demand matches peak resource availability) will make any sort of standardization we do a bit weird. I think it will effectively mute any sort of standardization. Maybe that's okay? Maybe (based on next point) we then just predict those should show lower correlations with fitness. 


- Mismatch hypothesis seems to predict all species in a community do the same thing -- all aim to match peak energetic demand matches peak resource availability; but selection in a multi species environment should mean some species would not aim for that (and they probably would be the ones where total fitness is not tied so strongly to that match). 


- HMK11 removes nest predation before doing analysis; HMK42 mentions nest predation is biggest controller on their fitness measures. 

- I know the authors of HMK42 pretty well and have met one author of HMK30 (Kerby).

- Clear from reviewing these that all the cut diagrams of resource curves are lies! These curves are much messier -- flatter, lumpier etc. I wondered if there were some simple models you could do about overlap of curves that would provide insight (basically, if you assume curves are flatter, then what are fitness outcomes of asynchrony?), but it would be much more a modeling project (not null models exactly) which seems outside anything we'd want to. 


- Related to above, a good side project for someone? Get the raw data and do distribution overlap instead of these sad point estimates that we're stuff with. Honestly just plotting the raw data of these resource curves (and consumer curves) could be illuminating and helpful to modelers. 

- Also someday idea -- use raw data and account for individual ID effects etc.

Overall thoughts-
- I wonder whether new papers might be easier to deal with, higher expectations about defining mismatch?
- Standardizing match across studies (i.e. to have a single definition of match) still seems impossible OR at least difficult if using all studies
- same battle as 2017- defining 0 vs. defining match
- need a new list of criteria, maybe more refined than Samplonius, checklist for studies (e.g., defined 0 (easier) vs defined match (harder))
- think about amount of food vs. just availability

Papers:
HMK025
France 1985-2010
Roe deer and vegetation
(assumption 1) Phenology: seasonal range NOT well defined for either taxa, vague- end of April to mid-June
'match'= median birth date- mean flowering date
Defined 0 *BUT* not clear when peak demand is
Standardized mismatch so that 0 is base year
(assumption 2) this population is not subject to predation or hunting pressure


HMK054
Netherlands 1973-2011
great tits and caterpillars
(assumption 1) Phenology: Seasonal range for both taxa well defined
'match'= (laying date+30 days)- peak caterpillar frass
Defined 0- peak demand is 9-10 after hatching

RE001
Greenland 1996-2013
*migratory* birds and arthropods; is migratory an issue?
(assumption 1) Phenology: seasonal range NOT well defined (June-July)
'match'= chick hatch date- peak arthropod abundance
Defined 0 *BUT* but not clear when peak demand is
- (assumption 2) evidence that resource abundance closely predicts consumer fitness

HMK058
France 1986-2011
Pyrenean chamois (mountain mammal, isard) and vegetation
(assumption 1) Phenology: seasonal range for both well defined (plant March 11 to May20), for consumer look at fig 3 
(assumption 2)- no natural predators in the study area
'match'= birth date- onset of spring plant phenology
not explicit about peak energetic demand BUT do mention that late gestation and early lactation have HIGH (rather than highest) energetic demands

adding fitness notes

HMK025
- mean individual fitness (annual asymptotic population growth rate, annual mean fitness)
- early survival (cohort-specific, proportion of fawns that survived to the onset of winter each year)
- Yes total fitness
- still can't draw figure

HMK054
-individual (fledgling success, offspring recruitment probability, number of recruits)and population level fitness
- Yes total fitness
- Yes can draw figure

RE001
- clutch survival
-chick growth- body mass
I don't think total fitness
- no can't draw figure

HMK058
- tracked population size but not clearly they link to relative timing
- goal seemed to predict timing of birth 
- no can't draw figure 

Other thoughts
-individual- level data- definitely more mammal and bird-centric.
-out of 8 studies, 3-4 seem potentially useable, likely only few systems where this will be possible. Is this interesting?

Questions:
How do fitness consequences change for consumer depending on shape/degree of temporal overlap?

HMK074

- Deirdre happened to have emailed these authors for data so I think we should wait to receive it. I just emailed them again (11 Sep 2020, original email 5 Sep 2020, plus whenever Deirdre asked)
- This is a tri-trophic sycamore tree -> 2 aphid species -> family of parasitoids (not ID-ed further).
- Phenology data: Fig 1
- Fitness data ... HARDER! They mention aphid population growth as a f(x) of tree "mismatch between tree and parasitoid attack" so I think they do not give mismatch between adjacent trophic levels? But we could construct it ...?
- Seasonality -- not mentioned, but they only sampled in certain windows
- Resource dominant control on consumer -- no, they test for and find density dependence 
- Data is at scale of individual tree ID originally (so plant is at individual, and upper trophic levels are counts per tree as best I understand), but we don't have access to that 

- Events
	- Trees: Sycamore leafing phenology was calculated as the closest Julian date at which 50% of the trees had achieved budburst (stage 4).
	- Aphids:  Emergence phenology for D. platanoidis and P. testudinaceus was calculated as the date in which aphid abundance reached 10% of the total cumulative annual abundance recorded on the focal tree. 
	- Phenology of parasitoid attack occurrence was calculated as the date in which the number of aphids parasitized reached 10% of the total cumulative number of parasitized aphids.

- Aphids are differing levels of specialists: "The focal aphid species differ in their selectivity of host plants with D. platanoidis being largely confined to sycamore (Douglas, 1993), whilst P. testudinaceus select a wider range of tree species within the Aceraceae family (Wilkaniec & Sztukowska, 2008)."

- I may be missing it, but I cannot figure out why they define mismatch as non-adjacent trophic levels.
