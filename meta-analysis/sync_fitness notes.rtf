-Also exclude studies from same location on same interaction (HMK050- Parus major at Hoge Veluwe NP, Netherlands from 1973-2011; HMK054 same ! - chose HMK054 because

\fs36 NOTES FOR ANALYSIS\
1. used pheno phases that were used by authors in their mismatch calculation\
2.  used THEIR mismatch values whenever possible\
3.  standardized mismatch scale for all interactions-\
	- larger values=further days apart (worse)	\
	WHEN negative and positive values:\
	b) for interactions where fitness data is for CONSUMER, then mismatch is calculated such that positive values= what\'92s better for 	consumer e.g. consumer emerges when there is food (therefore mismatch=consumer-resource)\
	c) for interactions where fitness data is for RESOURCE, then mismatch is calculated such that positive values= what\'92s better for\
	resource e.g. prey emerges BEFORE predator \
3.  double checked that larger values of mismatch= further apart (magnitude only, direction doesn\'92t matter i.e. before or after), will take absolute value (i.e. larger/higher values= increasing mismatch)\
4. chose best fitness proxy when multiple per spp (HMK011-3, HMK026-2, HMK029-2, HMK030-2, HMK016-3, HMK050-4, HMK002-2, HMK042-3, HMK025-3, HMK046-2, HMK054-2); current- prioritize demographic over fitness EXCEPT HMK042\
5. Definitions of fitness- lifetime fitness (average lifetime reproductive output per individual)> integrated fitness (survival X reprod; population growth rate)>demographic (abundance, density)> reproductive (number of offspring per individual)\
6. Get rid of HMK018 because fitness is modelled as residuals\
7.  Can\'92t fit quadratic because assuming specific relationship but unlikely to be the same negative vs. positive (e.g. without food vs. without good food)\

quadratic or linear\

\cf0 Mismatch calculations- Two types:\
Authors calculated mismatch themselves\
OR I used raw pheno data and took difference\
Units are index, percentage, days\
-Think about looking at variability/variation in fitness over years\
** THINK ABOUT WHETHER I SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR POPULATION FIRST BEFORE LOOKING AT SYNCHRONY~FITNESS!\
*some mistakes found for pheno frequency for first paper\
- assuming mismatch effects will be visible on X measure of consequence (could be wrong measure) OR assuming reproductive success (for ex) is largely determined by synchrony (temporal overlap)  BUT length of period over which food is available  (width of food peak) and max amount of biomass available (height of peak) also important\
- two measures of mismatch IN A SINGLE study- HMK049\
- will need to check all fitness classifications- e.g. is parasitism demographic? Don\'92t trust classifications! \
- RECHECK WHTHER ANY AXES WERE LOGGED AND NOT ACCOUNTED FOR WHEN DIGITIZED!\
-HMK052 - fitness actually measured on negative spp (in this case host of parasite) (also one for AO001)\
-using operational definition of mismatch- i.e. NOT defined by fitness (i.e. where highest fitness is where mismatch is 0)\
\
Studies with consumer AND resource fitness data\

AO001\

\
Studies with ONLY resource fitness data\
SET005 (BUT objective of paper was breeding success of consumers so not sure how good fitness proxy is for resource)\
HMK057\
\
Studies with multiple sites\
HMK035\
\
Two types of papers:\
1. papers with years such that all questions can be asked (e.g. link mismatch to pop decline over time)\
2. data available but no years provided, can only ask question about mismatch and fitness consequence\
\
TRY DEMOGRAPH* OR POPULATION*\
\
\
Discussion\
- negative impact of mismatch can be quickly overcome in response to subsequent favourable conditions\
- evidence for mismatch- change in timing (days) OR change in food QUALITY during pheno phase of consumer\
\
\
Related ideas:\
mismatch between interacting species (biotic mismatch)\
mismatch between species and abiotic environment (abiotic mismatch)\
mismatch between interacting species/populations across space \
